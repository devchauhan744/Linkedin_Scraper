Data Analyst,Rippling,"San Francisco, CA",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-analyst-at-rippling-4291544768?position=5&pageNum=0&refId=yEGJProhTT%2FZLh6%2FuBnV3w%3D%3D&trackingId=AtTDiBetIVeMc8nvutGzCA%3D%3D,"About RipplingRippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.About The RoleRippling is building the future of how businesses run — and our Data Cloud team is on a mission to give every customer a full-stack data platform to understand and operate their business, across every function: HR, IT, Finance, and beyond.We’re looking for a Data Analyst to join our product team — but this isn’t your typical analyst role. You won’t be sitting in a silo writing dashboards for exec reviews. Instead, you’ll be at the center of how we dogfood our own analytics products, solve real reporting needs for our internal teams (starting with HR), and translate those solutions into customer-facing templates, recipes, and product feedback.If you’re the kind of person who’s happiest when you’re deep in SQL one minute, building dashboards the next, and collaborating with product managers to make tools better the minute after that — this is your role.What You Will DoSupport internal reporting use cases: Be the go-to person for Rippling’s internal HR reporting needs — helping them define the right metrics, write the SQL, and build clean dashboards using our own reporting tools. Productize real solutions: Take the reports and dashboards you build for internal teams and turn them into recipes or templates that any Rippling customer can use. Shape the future of the product: Because you’ll be living in our product every day, you’ll become a key voice for what’s working and what’s not — surfacing gaps, proposing improvements, and even influencing the roadmap. Be the “power user” of our data stack: Our team builds everything from ingestion to transformation to dashboards. You’ll be working across this full stack, helping make it more usable and scalable through your daily work. Drive self-serve analytics adoption: Help internal teams (starting with HR) reduce their dependence on ad hoc requests by building the right dashboards and templates to unlock self-serve. What Success Looks LikeInternal teams can get the reports they need faster — and without asking twice. Your dashboards become models for how customers solve similar reporting problems. Your feedback helps us make major product improvements. We ship better data products because you’ve helped us dogfood our own tools thoroughly and thoughtfully. You are seen as both a trusted reporting partner and a product-minded analyst who can bridge internal needs and customer-facing solutions. What You Will Need3+ years working with data. Proficiency in SQL and hands-on experience with data exploration and dashboarding tools (Looker, Mode, Tableau, etc.). A strong sense of product empathy — you don’t just solve the problem, you think about how others could solve it too. Experience working with People, HR, or GTM teams is a plus. Comfort navigating ambiguity, unstructured questions, and imperfect data. Bonus: familiarity with dbt, analytics engineering, or data governance principles. Why This Role Is SpecialThis role lives inside the product team, not on a siloed analytics team. That means:Your work directly informs how we build and improve our data products. You’re empowered to propose ideas, templates, and workflows based on real usage. You get to see immediate impact — both internally and externally — from what you build. This is a great fit for someone who wants to stay hands-on with data, but also get exposure to product development and influence what we ship.Apply if…You love using data to unlock clarity for others. You get excited by operational reporting — not just vanity metrics. You want to be part of a team building powerful tools and using them every day. You’re curious, self-directed, and opinionated about what great looks like. Additional InformationRippling is an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce and do not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, veteran or military status, or any other legally protected characteristics, Rippling is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities who need assistance during the hiring process.
